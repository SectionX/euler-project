# euler-project
Solutions for the euler project. From first to last.

For some problems I will use Python, for others I will use C++
Frankly, writing in Python is way faster. It's less verbose
it allows me to use a functional paradigm which is really good
when doing math.

I do however want to get some experience with C++. Working with
such a language is a lot of work but it teaches me discipline
and better debugging practices.

I may try another language in the future. However I will always explain
the solution.
